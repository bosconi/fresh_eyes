This repoistory holds resources related to the **Fresh Eyes Workshop**, which presents tools and techniques for the application of Machine Learning (ML) to Generative Architectural Design (GAD). 

The workshop is based on a modest modification of a 3-step process that is well-known in generative architectural design, and that proceeds as: generate, evaluate, iterate. In place of the typical approaches to the evaluation step of this cycle, here we employ an ML process: a Convolutional Neural Net (CNN) trained to perform image classification. Such an approach allows the integration of a variety of tacit and heretofore un-encapsulatable design criteria - such as architectural style, spatial experience, or typological features - into existing generative design workflows.
